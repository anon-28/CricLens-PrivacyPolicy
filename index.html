        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          CricLens primarily stores analysis sessions, metrics, preferences, and training progress locally on your device.
          We do not upload your videos or core analysis results to our own servers by default.
          If a future cloud feature requires upload or sync, we will clearly request your consent in-app first.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sharing, Ads, and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal data. CricLens uses third-party SDKs and platform services where needed,
          such as on-device ML processing, notifications infrastructure, and ad delivery for ad-supported experiences.
          These providers process data according to their own privacy terms.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>

          <li>You can delete recorded clips, exported files, and app data from your device at any time.</li>
          <li>You can disable notifications and revoke camera/microphone/storage permissions in your device settings.</li>
          <li>You can choose whether to use premium-only or ad-supported features where available.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Data stored locally remains on your device until you delete it, clear app data, or uninstall the app.
          Notification-related identifiers are retained only as long as needed for notification delivery or as required by platform services.
        </p>

          has provided personal information, please contact us to request deletion.
